## What is a capability model
Capability models are tools to help people develop by identifying opportunities, and guiding their progress to improvement.

The models describe high-level activities that contribute to the overall success of an initiative, and describe how the activities would be performed at different skill levels.

After identifying how well they're doing at a particular activity, people can look at how the activity is performed at a higher skill level, giving them direction and guidance about they can improve.


## Our model
We've developed this model based on what we've learned throughout our time helping Government agenceis build better services.

It's important that you don't feel bad about what maturity level you are in the model - it's only purpose is to help you improve - so be honest.

Please don't use the model to criticise - it's based on our opinions and experiences, which aren't perfect.
