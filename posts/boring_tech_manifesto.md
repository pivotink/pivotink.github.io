## Preface to the manifesto

The web evolves at a very rapid pace.

Tools and languages appear to rise and fall from popularity almost overnight. A constant battle rages between between bleeding edge development, and supporting older browsers.

It is easy to get carried away without a clear vision for how technology will meet your user's needs.

Commercial services live and die by the profit they make, based on the number of users they have. They use modern web technologies to create engaging experiences, hoping to outshine the competition. These experiences are compelling enough that users will change their browsing behaviour to use them.

If Facebook needs users to update to the latest version of chrome, there is a good chance most users will. If twitter needs javascript to show users how many characters a tweet has left, users will enable it. Any user who doesn't browse the web in the way these companies expect will fall through the cracks. For these services, losing a few users is an acceptable trade off to deliver a great user experience to everyone else.

But government services are different.

People use government services because they need to, not because they want to. The government is obligated to make our services accessible to everyone who needs to use them. We don't have the luxury of telling people to upgrade their browser, or to turn javascript on. Some people aren't able. Others choose not to.

It doesn't matter what their reasons are, we should let users interact with us on their terms, not ours.

If that means using boring technology that is so simple it’s ubiquitous, that’s what we’ll do.

Boring technology actually has a lot of advantages, for both users and government.

It's small. The web has a habit of bloating when too much is added. Bloated pages take longer to download, and cost users more money in internet charges.

It's simple. Most technologists can do it pretty well already, and it's quick and cheap to teach.

Perhaps the biggest advantage of boring technology is that it forces us to do more with less.

Less code.

Less dependencies.

Less cost.

Less distractions.

More time to focus on the user.

## Online services work for everyone, regardless of their technology choices

Developing services that work for everyone means compromising the web features we use. Javascript, css and even images aren't guaranteed to be supported by everyone, but HTML is.

If your browser only supports HTML, then our services will still work for you. 

## Provide boring alternatives for exceptional features that need javascript

Some features simply can't be implemented without javascript, and that's ok. Being boring isn't about restricting what users can do online. It's about offering alternatives that give a 'good enough' experience to your users. It's about carefully thinking if there is a simpler way.

And when you do find a simpler way, maybe you will realise you didn't need the javascript version after all.

## Justify the extra effort to enhance beyond boring

Once you have a working service using boring technology, you'll likely want to enhance it. This isn't a bad thing. Boring technology is boring for a reason. It has limitations, sometimes big ones.

Before making enhancements, ask yourself these four questions:

- What is the need?
- What are the alternatives?
- What is the cost?
- Who will it exclude?

Make sure you, your team, and your users are happy with the answers before progressing.

## Push the boundaries of boring tech

Being boring doesn't mean that there aren't any challenging problems or innovations left. Finding better and simpler ways to progressively enhance your services isn't easy.

Here are some principles that help drive advancements in boring tech:

- Do more with less.
- Not we can't, how might we.
- Do the hard work to make it simple.
